## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I am Francis Lopes, Brazilian/Italian and living in Spain. I have a background in Mechanical Engineering and at this moment I am studying to be a Software Engineer. Little by little I am discovering this new world and to be honest I am enjoying this challenge a lot.

Here you can find more info about the courses I did and feel free to ask me any question you may have about myself. 

- ðŸ˜„ I like to travel and spend time with my family.
- ðŸ˜„ Hiking and camping is one of my passions.
- ðŸ˜„ I am very open to making new friends :)
